# Discourse Homepage Toggle
This Discourse theme component adds a toggleable homepage in the header, allowing users to jump between two pages that can be set in the theme component settings. 
It uses the primary and tertiary colors from your theme automatically.
You can set the icons for each side of the toggle in the theme component settings.
